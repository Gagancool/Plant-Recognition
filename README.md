# Plant-Recognition
Plant recognition has been a challenging study since the early last century. With the development of image processing and pattern recognition, plant recognition has become possible. It has applications in weeds identification, species discovery, plant taxonomy, disease detection and even natural reserve park management.

## Task Description 
This project aims to classify leaves using traditional handcrafted features and features extracted from pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks (ConvNets).
## Approach 
Feature extraction plays the most important role in determining the accuracy and precision of a machine learning mechanism. This is stemmed from the fact that the architecture for machine learning essentially depends on the predetermined feature that is prompted into the network. There is no single feature extraction technique that can be considered as the best method since different problems require different approaches and different mechanisms. 

I have used the [Swedish Leaf Dataset](https://www.cvl.isy.liu.se/en/research/datasets/swedish-leaf/) for my project due to the larger training images/ class factor and a constraint on resources. It provides images with only one leaf and a clean background, making it more distant from the real world scenario.
